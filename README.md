# Margic Mirror

Develop a [magic mirror](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/) using c#, Raspberry Pi... The project is not finalized.

It takes a two way mirror, stuffs a monitor behind it, and then powers the whole thing with a Raspberry Pi running windows 10 IoT. This means that it pulls data from an application set up on the Pi, so you can easily update and create your own display with little coding skills.

I would like to integrate cortana and another web services.

## Installation

Donwload the code and use Visual Studio to compile. 

## State

In progress.
